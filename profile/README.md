## Overview  

**PopClip for Mac** is a versatile productivity tool that enhances text selection and contextual actions on macOS.  
When you select text anywhere on your Mac, PopClip appears instantly, offering a customizable set of actions like copy, paste, search, and more.  

The app supports numerous extensions, letting you perform tasks such as translating text, opening URLs, sending emails, or even applying text formatting directly from the selection.  
Its lightweight design ensures it works seamlessly in the background without affecting system performance, making it suitable for both casual users and professionals who want to speed up their workflow.  

PopClip integrates with macOS natively, providing smooth animations, intuitive gestures, and a modern interface that feels like a built-in feature rather than a separate utility.  
With PopClip, everyday text interactions become faster, smarter, and more efficient, transforming the way you work across apps.
